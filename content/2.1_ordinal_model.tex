The first analysis, which we termed~\textbf{sign analysis}, focuses on understanding how the outcomes from different instruments align with participants' donation behavior in terms of preference order. To achieve this, we construct pairwise comparisons between the two sets.We employ logistic regression to analyze the alignment between the instrument outcomes and donation behaviors. Each pairwise comparison examines if the preference order from these instruments corresponds to the donation order, assessing if these methods reflect consistent ordinal preferences.
