\section{Detailed Qualitative Cognitive Load Breakdown}
\label{apdx:cog_qual}

We provide additional details on the six cognitive dimensions. Among all dimensions, we also provide the codes representing different types of demand in a table form. The shaded cells represent the percentage of participants citing each source of mental demand, allowing for comparison within columns. The abbreviations in the columns: ST (Short Text Interface), S2P (Short Two-phase Interface), LT (Long Text Interface), and L2P (Long Two-phase Interface). Short and Long refer to the sum across both interfaces; Text and 2P (Two-phase interface) refer to the sum across both survey lengths. We include Sparklines for comparisons across these experiment groups. Future studies can use these as initial codebooks to conduct interface studies on preference construction.

\begin{table*}[p]
   \caption{This table lists all the causes participants mentioned as contributing to their Mental Demand.}
   \Description{A table presenting mental demand across categories such as Budget Management (track credits, maximize usage), Preference Construction (prioritization, resource allocation), and Demand from Experiment Setup. Sparklines and percentage bars are used to visually represent the data across four interface versions (ST, S2P, LT, L2P) and experiment conditions (Short, Long, Text, Inter). The bars show higher mental demand in areas like Budget Management and Preference Construction, with trends highlighted by sparklines. Additional categories, such as External Factors and Demand due to Interface, are also represented with percentage bars.}

\begin{table*}[p]

    \Description{A table showing physical challenges experienced by participants, including Reading, Mouse, Vertical Screen, and None/Little physical effort, with sparklines and percentage bars visualizing the data trends. Data is split across four interface versions (ST, S2P, LT, L2P) and experiment conditions (Short, Long, Text, Inter). The Mouse category has the highest counts, with trends clearly visible via sparklines and bars, while Reading and Vertical Screen challenges have lower values. The None/Little row shows participants reporting minimal physical effort with percentage bars illustrating the distribution.}

\begin{table*}[p]

    \Description{A table summarizing participant effort as Operational and Strategic (personal and global), with data visualized using sparklines and percentage bars. The table is split into four versions (ST, S2P, LT, L2P) and experiment conditions (Short, Long, Text, Inter), with counts and corresponding bars for each category. The operational effort shows participants managing tasks, while the strategic effort captures balancing personal preferences with societal concerns. Sparklines highlight trends across different conditions. A None/Little/A bit row shows participants exerting minimal effort, visualized with bars.}

\subsection{Sources of Mental Demand}
\label{apdx:mental}
Mental demand refers to the amount of mental and perceptual activity required to complete a task.~\Cref{tbl:mental} lists all qualitative codes and ~\Cref{fig:mental_cog_score} shows the boxplot of participant's subscale response. For thematic groups, we grouped them as source of demand (e.g., tracking remaining credits) and also of scope (e.g., Operational) as separated by the light gray line within each row.

\subsection{Sources of Physical Demand} 
\label{apdx:physical}
Physical demand refers to the physical effort required to complete a task, such as physical exertion or movement. Most participants reported minimal physical demand~($N=32$), reflected in the low NASA-TLX physical demand scores~(Figure~\ref{apdxfig:physical_cog_score}). Notably, $11$ out of $20$ participants who used the two-phase interface mentioned physical demand from using the mouse, reflecting interacting with two interfaces. This is further supported by the raw NASA-TLX physical demand scores~(Figure~\ref{apdxfig:physical_cog_score}), which show a significant visual difference between short and long two-phase interfaces as well as between text and two-phase interfaces in long surveys. Table~\ref{apdx:physical_table} presents all the relevant codes across experiment groups.

\end{table*}


\subsection{Source of Effort}
\label{apdx:effort}
Effort refers to how hard participants felt they worked to achieve the level of performance they did. Since effort includes both mental and physical resource intensity, refer to \Cref{apdx:mental} and \Cref{apdx:physical} for definitions. Raw NASA-TLX effort scores~(Figure~\ref{apdxfig:effort_cog_score}) showed a similar spread across experiment groups, the qualitative analysis showed more distinction that participants using the two-phase interface considered options more comprehensively and felt less effort on completing operational tasks, similar to what we found on mental demands~(Section \ref{apdx:mental}). For this subscale, we grouped codes through the lens of scope. Table~\ref{apdx:effort_table} contains codes. 

$14$ of the $20$ participants using the text interface mentioned operational tasks as a source of effort, compared to $7$ participants using the two-phase interface, with the lowest mention in the long two-phase interface group~($N=2$).

\begin{displayquote}
I wanted to bump up~(an option) maybe to 4 or <option> to 5 and realize I couldn't.~\bracketellipsis that would be effort came in of how do I want to really rearrange this to make it~(the budget spending) maximize?

\noindent \hfill -- S029, short text interface
\end{displayquote}

In contrast, strategic planning was reported as an effort source by $11$ participants in the text interface, compared to $17$ participants in the two-phase interface, with nearly all participants in the long two-phase interface group~($N=9$) expressing effort related to it. In this subscale, we further categorize strategic planning into \textit{narrow} and \textit{broad} scopes as we did for mental demand~(\Cref{apdx:mental}). Participants using the two-phase interface~($N=7$) had nearly mentioned double~($N=4$) times regarding global strategies. For example:

\begin{displayquote}
~\bracketellipsis the effort was how to rank order these~(options) and allocate the resources behind the upvotes so that I can accurately depict what I want~\ldots say, a committee to focus on and allocate actual fungible resources, too. \noindent \hfill -- S019, long two-phase interface
\end{displayquote}

    \Description{A table with sparklines showing frustration categories: Strategic (higher-level and lower-level) and Operational, across four versions (ST, S2P, LT, L2P) and experiment conditions (Short, Long, Text, Inter). The table includes sparklines and percentage bars alongside the numerical counts to visually represent the data distribution across conditions. Strategic frustration is divided into higher-level and lower-level conflicts between personal preference and broader societal values. Operational frustration includes challenges such as credit management, adhering to the quadratic mechanism, making decisions, and understanding options. A final row captures participants reporting None/Little frustration, also visualized with percentage bars.}

\subsection{Source from Performance}
\label{apdx:performance}

Performance refers to a person's perception of how successfully they have completed a task. Lower values indicate good perceived performance, while higher values suggest poor perceived performance. Raw NASA-TLX scores~(Figure~\ref{fig:performance_cog_score}) show that participants had similar performance scores, although we highlighted nuanced differences in the main text. In addition to the differences mentioned in the main text, an interesting theme that emerged across experimental conditions was that participants' identified that \textit{Social Responsibility} influenced their performance scores.~\Cref{tbl:perf} presents a detailed breakdown of our codes.

\paragraph{Social Responsibility.} This theme refers to concerns about performance when participants reflected on how their final vote counts would be perceived by others~(\smallquote{S041}{I don't want people to think that I just don't care about <ethnicity> people at all}) or how their votes might influence real-world decision-making~(\smallquote{S027}{Some of these things might \ldots have outcomes that I didn't foresee}).

The performance scores appear relatively low across all conditions, with medians hovering between 20 and 40.}
