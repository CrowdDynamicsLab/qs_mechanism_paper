\begin{abstract}
    The Quadratic Survey (QS) is an emerging method that has demonstrated advantages over traditional methods such as the Likert scale survey for eliciting individual preferences in collective decision-making. It sets itself apart by featuring two key components: a quadratic cost function for votes and a fixed credit budget. This study empirically examines the role of the two components in the QS's effectiveness in isolation, by comparing the performance of QS and Likert scale survey to two variants of QS: Unlimited QS, which removes the budget constraint, and Linear Surveys, which replace the quadratic cost with a linear function. In a controlled experiment with MTurk participants, survey responses from Unlimited QS and Linear Surveys were evaluated alongside the existing QS and Likert scale responses reported in prior work, and all responses were compared against an incentive-compatible donation task. Hierarchical Bayesian analyses reveal that QS more effectively aligns expressed preferences with actual donation behavior, while omitting either component degrades performance. The results also confirm that both pairwise rankings and interval intensity differences between options captured by QS closely reflect individual behavior, outperforming both the Likert scale and Constant Sum-like surveys. These findings advance our understanding of QS and provide practitioners with an alternative tool to collect reflective individual preferences for collective decision-making contexts such as democratic engagement or public resource allocation.
